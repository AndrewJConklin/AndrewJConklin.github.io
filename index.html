                <p> My name is Andrew Conklin and I am a disciplined, hardworking, 
                    and fun-loving young professional currently working as a Customer 
                    Service Team Leader for Ford Motor Credit Company. I grew up in Randolph, 
                    New Jersey and currently live in Tampa, Florida. I am the 2nd youngest of 
                    6 children. I am married to my wonderful wife, Kara, and together we have 
                    2 adorable and very fluffy cats. My main hobbies are weightlifting, 
                    running, baking, and playing video games. I graduated with my bachelorâ€™s 
                    degree in Financial Management from Clemson University. I have performed 
                    many different roles for Ford Credit including Loss Prevention CSR, 
                    Commercial Dealer Service Analyst, Commercial Credit Analyst, Dealer 
                    Credit Analyst, Title Room Team Leader, and Customer Service Center 
                    Team Leader.  One of my aspirations in life is to continually  push 
                    myself out of my comfort zone in the search of personal growth.

                <p> I would like to become a software engineer because software engineering is 
                    the cutting edge of technology mixed with the lifelong art of creation. It 
                    is a versatile skill that offers a broad range of possible applications. Not 
                    only does becoming a Software Engineer open up opportunities to work in IT 
                    roles, it also opens up opportunities to use Software Engineering in conjunction 
                    with other skills and expertise. In particular, I am interested in applying 
                    my skills as a Software Engineer with my education and experience in the Finance 
                    industry. In addition to the variety of positions available to a software engineer, 
                    I am also interested in the position because it allows for problem solving, teamwork, 
                    and creativity. Problem solving keeps me engaged and ensures that I will consistently 
                    be improving my technical skills. I am always looking for opportunities that 
                    involve teamwork because I enjoy working together to achieve feats that would be 
                    impossible to do on my own. Finally, I appreciate the creativity that comes with 
                    writing code. It is incredible to me just how much you can create through writing 
                    lines of code.
